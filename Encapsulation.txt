1. Instance variables
    The variables which are in constructors because the values of variables if different for different object

2. What is encapsulation?
nothing is python is truly private
example:
        sbi._Atm__Balance = 'sadfafasf'
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). 
It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. 
This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. 
To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method.
Those types of variables are known as private variables.
