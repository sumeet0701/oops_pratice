what is self in OOPS ?
    self is object so i will store a any place in memory it has id and address 
    class is itself is a self function 

    examples
    from OOPS import AtmMachine
    sbi = AtmMachine()

    so the address of sbi is same as address of self in class
    it means sbi is self ha

    example :
    hdfc = AtmMachine()

    id(hdfc)
    then self is hdfc 

the current working object is a self function
jo bhe object ka sath hum abhi kaam kar raha ha vohi self hota 

using magic methods we can bulid different types of objects or data types
